# Scenario 1
1. Try to solidify Scenario1.txt
Why do you think this .TXT file is able to be solidified?
2. Try to make a change to Scenario1.txt using a NON-UPDATER
E.g., in CMD, run the following command: **echo test >> Scenario1.txt**
3. Configure a SKIPLIST to allow modification of this SOLIDIFIED file by a NON-UPDATER process (e.g. cmd.exe)
